        Hello, my name is Edwin (Leo) Najera Gonzalez, and I am a sophomore
        currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science. I have developed a
        growing interest and passion for software development. As I continue my
        academic journey, I am also working to strengthen my foundation in
        computer science, focusing on languages such as C++, Python, and Java,
        along with front-end technologies like React using TypeScript and
        JavaScript. While I don’t have many major projects under my belt yet, I
        am actively building smaller projects that allow me to explore and apply
        the concepts I learn in class and during my personal time.
        <br />
        <br />I am eager to expand my knowledge and experience, excited to take
        on new challenges and tasks in the tech world. Currently, my focus is on
        improving my coding skills and tackling real-world problems through the
        projects I’m creating. My goal is to build a strong portfolio and
        continue to grow as both a software developer and a computer scientist.
        <br />
